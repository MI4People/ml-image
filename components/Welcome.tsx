          commitment to &quot;AI for good,&quot; focusing on making cutting-edge
          medical diagnostics accessible to all, especially in developing
          countries where such technology can have a transformative impact on
          healthcare. Users of X-Ray Insight can upload multiple X-ray images to
          receive AI-driven assessments on the probability of 14 possible
          conditions. This service leverages a sophisticated AI model based on
          research, as detailed in the paper available at{" "}

          . Our technology utilizes Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping
          (Grad-CAM) to visually highlight the regions within the image that
          influenced the AI&apos;s assessments, thereby enhancing the clarity
          and usefulness of the analysis. Created and hosted by MI4People, X-Ray
          Insight is part of our broader mission to apply AI technologies for
          societal benefit. By bridging the gap between advanced AI research and
          practical applications in medical settings, we aim to empower
          healthcare professionals worldwide with tools that are not only
          innovative but also accessible and easy to use. This initiative is
          particularly aimed at supporting medical practitioners in developing
          countries, providing them with access to diagnostic tools that were
          previously out of reach due to technological and financial
          constraints. This application is more than just a tool; it&apos;s a
          part of MI4People&apos;s vision to harness the potential of AI for
          positive social impact, making significant strides towards leveling
          the playing field in global health.
